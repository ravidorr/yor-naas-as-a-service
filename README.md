# YorNaaS

> **Deprecated:** YorNaaS has moved to [YESorNOaaS](https://github.com/ravidorr/yes-or-no-as-a-service). Use `npm install -g @ravidor/yesornoaas` instead of `@ravidor/yornaas`.

Yes or No as a Service.

Call the answer routes:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/yes   # Yes!
curl http://localhost:3000/api/no    # No!
```

Unknown paths return `404 text/plain` with a hint. Rate-limited requests return
`429` with the same hint.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm

## Install

Install globally from npm:

```sh
npm install -g @ravidor/yornaas
```

Or clone and run locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ravidorr/yor-naas-as-a-service.git
cd yor-naas-as-a-service
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

The UI is available at `http://localhost:3000`.
Use `?request=` and optional `?answer=yes|no` to open a shareable YorNaaS flow
that types and submits the request automatically.

Health check:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Output:

```json
{"status":"YorNaaS","version":"1.0.0"}
```

Prometheus metrics:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

Output is Prometheus text format (`text/plain; charset=utf-8; version=0.0.4`).
The endpoint is public, exempt from rate limiting, and remains available during
graceful shutdown.

Custom HTTP metrics:

- `yornaas_http_requests_total{route,method,status_code}`
- `yornaas_http_request_duration_seconds{route,method,status_code}`
- `yornaas_http_requests_in_flight{route,method}`

Route labels are normalized to `version`, `health`, `metrics`, `api_yes`,
`api_no`, or `not_found`. Scrape traffic to `/metrics` is not counted in the
custom HTTP metrics.

Standard Node.js process and runtime metrics (CPU, memory, event loop, GC) are
also included.

Treat `/metrics` as an internal operations endpoint. On the public internet,
bind to a private network, restrict access at your reverse proxy, or scrape
from an internal URL only. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for deployment
guidance.

Version:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/version
```

OpenAPI specification:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/openapi.yaml
```

Use a different port:

```sh
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Rate limiting applies to `/api/yes`, `/api/no`, and unknown routes. Static
assets, `GET /health`, and `GET /metrics` are exempt. Throttled requests return
`429` with the route hint.

Configure the limit with environment variables:

```sh
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000 RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100 npm start
```

Defaults are 100 requests per client IP every 15 minutes. Limits are stored in
process memory, so multiple instances do not share quota state.

Behind a reverse proxy or ingress, set `TRUST_PROXY` so limits key on the
client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` instead of the proxy IP:

```sh
TRUST_PROXY=1 npm start
```

Graceful shutdown applies when the process receives `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`.
During drain, `GET /health` returns `503` with the same JSON body.

Configure the drain deadline and readiness grace with:

```sh
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS=30000 SHUTDOWN_READINESS_GRACE_MS=1000 npm start
```

## Docker

Build the image locally:

```sh
docker build -t yornaas .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 yornaas
```

Verify the health check:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Use a different port:

```sh
docker run --rm -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 yornaas
```

## CLI

After a global install:

```sh
yornaas yes
yornaas no
```

For local development:

```sh
npm link
yornaas yes
```

Output:

```text
Yes!
```

## MCP

Run the stdio MCP server:

```sh
npm run mcp
```

After a global install or `npm link`, MCP clients can use:

```sh
yornaas-mcp
```

It exposes two tools:

- `yes`: returns `Yes!`
- `no`: returns `No!`

## Test

```sh
npm test
```

Contributors should also run the coverage gate before opening a pull request:

```sh
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
```
